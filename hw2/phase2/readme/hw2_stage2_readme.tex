	\section{Space Constraints}
	\textit{How much space does your program use?}
	
	Because I chose the static implementation, this program uses a lot of space. It uses two 2D-Arrays to contain the solutions and 
	error values. Both are roughly 10,000 by 10,000, the set limit for the problem size and number of iterations.
