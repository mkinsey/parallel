\maketitle

In this program I present a solution to Problem Set 3 from Udacity's \textit{Intro
to Parallel Programming} course. This program implements a parallel algorithm for
Building a histogram and cumulative distribution function given an array of 
values. All modified functions are in the \textit{student\_func.cu} file. 
For this assignment I used a one-dimensional kernel with 1024 threads to increase
the legibility of the program.
Execution time through the Udacity interface was around 2.4 ms.\\
